  "summary": "A drop-in UITableView/UICollectionView superclass category for showing empty datasets whenever the view has no content to display.",
  "description": "It will work automatically, by just conforming to DZNEmptyDataSetSource, and returning the data you want to show. The -reloadData call will be observed so the empty dataset will be configured whenever needed. It is (extremely) important to set the dataSetSource and dataSetDelegate to nil, whenever the view is going to be released. This class uses KVO under the hood, so it needs to remove the observer before dealocating the view.",
