## Installation

### CocoaPods

[CocoaPods](http://cocoapods.org) is a dependency manager for Cocoa projects. You can install it with the following command:

```bash
$ gem install cocoapods
```

> CocoaPods 1.1.0+ is required to build SnapKit 4.0.0+.

To integrate SnapKit into your Xcode project using CocoaPods, specify it in your `Podfile`:

```ruby
source 'https://github.com/CocoaPods/Specs.git'
platform :ios, '10.0'
use_frameworks!

target '<Your Target Name>' do
    pod 'SnapKit', '~> 5.0.0'
end
```

Then, run the following command:

```bash
$ pod install
```

### Carthage

[Carthage](https://github.com/Carthage/Carthage) is a decentralized dependency manager that builds your dependencies and provides you with binary frameworks.

You can install Carthage with [Homebrew](http://brew.sh/) using the following command:

```bash
$ brew update
$ brew install carthage
```

To integrate SnapKit into your Xcode project using Carthage, specify it in your `Cartfile`:

```ogdl
github "SnapKit/SnapKit" ~> 5.0.0
```

Run `carthage update` to build the framework and drag the built `SnapKit.framework` into your Xcode project.

### Manually

If you prefer not to use either of the aforementioned dependency managers, you can integrate SnapKit into your project manually.

## Usage

### Quick Start

```swift
import SnapKit

class MyViewController: UIViewController {

    lazy var box = UIView()

    override func viewDidLoad() {
        super.viewDidLoad()

        self.view.addSubview(box)
        box.snp.makeConstraints { (make) -> Void in
           make.width.height.equalTo(50)
           make.center.equalTo(self.view)
        }
    }

}
```

### Playground
You can try SnapKit in Playground.

**Note:**

> To try SnapKit in playground, open `SnapKit.xcworkspace` and build SnapKit.framework for any simulator first.
